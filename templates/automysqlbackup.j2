# By default, the Debian version of automysqlbackup will use:
# mysqldump --defaults-file=/etc/mysql/debian.cnf
# but you might want to overwrite with a specific user & pass.
# To do this, simply edit bellow.

# Username to access the MySQL server e.g. dbuser
{% if automysqlbackup_username %}
USERNAME={{ automysqlbackup_username }}
{% endif %}

# Password to access the MySQL server e.g. password
{% if automysqlbackup_password %}

DBHOST={{ automysqlbackup_host }}

# List of DBNAMES for Daily/Weekly Backup e.g. "DB1 DB2 DB3"
# Note that it's absolutely normal that the db named "mysql" is not in this
# list, as it's added later by the script. See the MDBNAMES directives below
# in this file (advanced options).
# This is ONLY a convenient default, if you don't like it, don't complain
# and write your own.
# The following is a quick hack that will find the names of the databases by
# reading the mysql folder content. Feel free to replace by something else.
# DBNAMES=`find /var/lib/mysql -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d | cut -d'/' -f5 | grep -v ^mysql\$ | tr \\\r\\\n ,\ `
